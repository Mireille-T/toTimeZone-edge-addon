 ![Time Zone Converter Icon](/icons/128x128.png)
## Description
Have you ever saw an event being hosted at a certain time in a certain time zone, and had to convert it manually or by opening a new tab online? With this addon, you can convert time zones in one tab!
## How it works
1. Add our addon.
2. Pin it to your addons bar.
3. Whenever you see a time to convert, just select the date, time and time zones (to be converted and to convert), then click on the "Convert!" button!
## Possible Extensions
- Time zone selection through location / time zone codes (e.g. UTC, IST, PT, etc.)
- Support for 12h format
- Context menu option allowing for time zone conversion without opening the extension
  - Can possibly be implemented through the [Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API), so when a user highlights a string containining a time and time zone and clicks on the context menu option, a notification containing the converted time will be shown; the time zone to convert to may possibly be specified by the user through an options menu
